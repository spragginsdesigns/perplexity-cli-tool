# Security Review for Perplexity CLI Tool

## Sensitive Information Findings

### 1. API Keys and Credentials

| File   | Type    | Details                        | Risk Level | Recommendation                                |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `.env` | API Key | Perplexity API Key: `REDACTED` | High       | Remove from repository and regenerate the key |

### 2. Configuration Files

The project properly handles configuration through:

- Environment variables
- Local configuration file stored at `~/.config/perplexity-cli/config.json` (not in the repository)

### 3. Git Configuration

The `.gitignore` file includes:

```
# Virtual Environment
.env
.venv
env/
venv/
ENV/
env.bak/
venv.bak/
```

This is correctly set up to exclude the `.env` file from being committed to the repository. However, the `.env` file is currently present in the repository, which indicates it may have been committed before the `.gitignore` was properly configured.

## Code Analysis

The codebase handles API keys securely:

1. **Loading API Keys**:

   - First checks environment variables (`PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`)
   - Falls back to a local config file outside the repository (`~/.config/perplexity-cli/config.json`)
   - Does not hardcode API keys in the source code

2. **Displaying API Keys**:

   - When displaying API keys in the CLI, they are properly masked:

   ```python
   masked_key = f"{config.api_key[:5]}{'*' * (len(config.api_key) - 9)}{config.api_key[-4:]}"
   ```

3. **Storing API Keys**:
   - API keys are sanitized before storage to remove non-ASCII characters
   - Configuration is stored outside the repository in the user's home directory

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:

   - Remove the `.env` file from the repository
   - Regenerate the Perplexity API key as it has been exposed
   - Add a note to the README about configuring API keys securely

2. **Future Improvements**:
   - Consider using a more secure method for storing API keys, such as a keyring or encrypted storage
   - Add a pre-commit hook to prevent committing files with potential API keys or secrets
   - Implement a secrets scanning tool in the CI/CD pipeline

## Summary

The project has one critical security issue: an exposed Perplexity API key in the `.env` file. While the codebase itself handles API keys securely and the `.gitignore` is properly configured to exclude the `.env` file, the file has already been committed to the repository.

The API key should be regenerated immediately, and the `.env` file should be removed from the repository to prevent further exposure.
